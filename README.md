# Do Popular Songs Endure?

## Introduction
Surprisingly, most of the popular enduring songs nowadays (as measured by current sales or airplay) were not actually ranked to the top of the charts when they first came out back in 1960s. The main objective of this project is to find the endurance of popular songs, and to formulate if songs which were popular at the time of their release actually remain their popularity over time. By investigation of a variety of datasets, the popularity of songs can be defined by various methods such as ranking functions which relate directly to number of views, Billboard rankings, etc, and other characteristics as well like number of sales, etc. Some other interesting factors that might contribute to the songs popularity can be explored more in depth with Million Songs Dataset for example, which include a rich features set about any particular songs such as its danceability, song_hotttness, analysis sample rate, types of genre, etc. Based on these features, we will build a model to predict the endurance of songsâ€™ popularity over time from the time they were released.
